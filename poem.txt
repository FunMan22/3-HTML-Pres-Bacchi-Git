Trusting in Hope


I trust in Hope
To make all right
To make all good
And to make all normal

I want for Hope
To end the virus
To stop the death
And to open the world

Hope is the reason
We can still stay happy
We can still look forward
And we can still work hard

Hope will remain
Until we defeat the virus
Until we return to normal life
And until we win this fight

Hope will remain forever
So long as we choose to trust in it
